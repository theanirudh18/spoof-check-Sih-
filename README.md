Traditional Signal-Based Methods (No heavy ML)
Detect temporal inconsistencies (e.g., repeating patterns in frames → video loop).
Use optical flow analysis (motion vectors should be smooth; sudden jumps → editing).  
Detect compression artifacts (different editing tools leave traces in pixel distribution).
